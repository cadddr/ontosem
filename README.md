DustJS Templating Docs: http://www.dustjs.com/

### Notes
  The server will automatically stop and restart when the code is changed

  The SCSS will automatically recompile when it is changed

  Add page-specific scripts via the "clientscripts" object that is passed to each template

  Add page-specific styling to a new .scss file and surround all code with a ".page-[pagename]" class â€“ in the .dust template for that page, import "layout" and pass it "page-[pagename]" as the page= attribute. See multitmr.dust as an example

  Tools/toggles/options should be added to the {toolbar} block. See multitmr.dust for an example

  Page content should be filled into the {content} block. See multitmr.dust for an example
